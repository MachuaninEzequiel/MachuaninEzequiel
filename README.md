<h2>🚀 Interests and Expertise</h2>
My primary areas of interest lie in data science and analytics, fields in which I've built a strong foundation. I also enjoy scripting to automate tasks and modeling coding competitions for fun. I firmly believe in the power of data to deliver value and practical solutions across any domain.<br><br>
<h2>🎯 Aspirations</h2>
My ultimate goal is to combine two of my passions: data science and soccer. I would love to work as an analyst and lead data collection for major soccer clubs. In the near term, I plan to develop a web app to collect and share statistics for the local soccer leagues in my city, giving clubs an accessible way to analyze and compare performance.<br><br>
<h2>💻 Current Projects</h2>
I’m currently working on a project that supports students across different colleges and universities, regardless of language or age. This project uses machine learning to detect and understand emotions through a language model (LLM) that enhances interaction and understanding among students.<br><br>
<h2>🤝 Collaboration and Development</h2>
I am always open to collaborating with passionate people who are eager to take on challenging projects. If you have an idea or think we could work together on something meaningful, feel free to reach out!<br><br>
<h2>🏢 Professional Experience</h2>
For the past two years, I've been part of CInApTIC (Applied Research Center for Information and Communication Technologies) at my university, contributing to a project focused on improving the deliverable processes within software development companies.<br><br>
